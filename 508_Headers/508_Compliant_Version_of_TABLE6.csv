,,Medicare cost reports submitted electronically must meet a variety of edits.  These include mathematical,,,,,,,,,,

,,produces an electronic cost report file for Medicare hospices must automate all of these edits.  Failure,,,,,,,,,,
,,to properly implement these edits may result in the suspension of a vendor's system certification until,,,,,,,,,,
,,corrective action is taken.  The vendor's software should provide meaningful error messages to notify the,,,,,,,,,,
,,hospice of the cause of every exception.  The edit message generated by the vendor systems must contain,,,,,,,,,,

,,rejection.  These edits also test for the presence of some critical data elements specified in Table 3.,,,,,,,,,,
,,Level II edits (2000 series edit codes) identify potential inconsistencies and/or missing data items.,,,,,,,,,,

,,payments being withheld pending resolution of the issue(s).,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,The vendor requirements (above) and the edits (below) reduce both intermediary (FI) processing time ,,,,,,,,,,
