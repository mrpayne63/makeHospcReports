,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROGRAMMERS,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,Cost center coding is required because there are thousands of unique cost center names in use by,,,,,,,,
,,providers.  Many of these names are peculiar to the reporting provider and give no hint as to the actual ,,,,,,,,
,,"function being reported.  By using codes to standardize meanings, practical data analysis becomes",,,,,,,,
,,possible.  The methodology to accomplish this must be rigidly controlled to enhance accuracy.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,"For any added cost center names (the preprinted cost center labels must be precoded), the preparer",,,,,,,,
,,must be presented with the allowable choices for that line or range of lines from the lists of standard,,,,,,,,
,,and nonstandard descriptions.  They will then select a description that best matches their added,,,,,,,,
,,"label.  The code associated with the matching description, including increments due to choosing",,,,,,,,
,,"the same description more than once, will then be appended to the user's label by the software.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,Additional guidelines are:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,, o,Any pre-existing codes for the line must not be allowed to carry over.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,, o,"All ""Other . . ."" lines must not be precoded.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,, o,"The order of choice is standard first, followed by specific nonstandard, and, lastly, the nonstandard",,,,,,,
,,,"""Other . . ."" cost centers.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,, o,"When the nonstandard ""Other . . ."" is chosen, the preparer must be prompted with ""Is this the most",,,,,,,
,,,"appropriate choice?"" and offered a chance to answer yes or to select another description.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,, o,The cost center coding process must be able to be invoked again for purposes of making corrections.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,, o,A separate list showing the preparer's added cost center names on the left with the chosen standard,,,,,,,
,,,or nonstandard description and code on the right must be printed for review.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,, o,The number of times a description can be selected on a given report must be displayed on the screen,,,,,,,
,,,next to the description and this number must decrease with each usage to show the remaining numbers,,,,,,,
,,,available.  The numbers are shown on the standard and nonstandard cost center tables.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,, o,"Standard cost center lines, descriptions, and codes are not to be changed.  The acceptable format for",,,,,,,
,,,these are displayed in the STANDARD COST CENTER DESCRIPTIONS AND CODES listed on ,,,,,,,
,,,pages 38-222.   The proper line number is the first two digits of the cost center code.,,,,,,,
,,,"All ""Other"" nonstandard lines should be changed to the appropriate cost center name.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
,,Coding of Cost Center Labels,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,Cost center coding is a methodology for standardizing the meaning of cost center labels as used by ,,,,,,,,
,,hospices on the Medicare cost report.  The use of this coding methodology allows providers to,,,,,,,,
,,continue to use their labels for cost centers that have meaning within the individual institution.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,The four digit codes that are required to be associated with each label provide standardized,,,,,,,,
,,"meaning for data analysis.   Normally, it is only necessary to code any added labels because the",,,,,,,,
,,preprinted STANDARD labels are automatically coded by CMS approved cost report software.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,Additional cost center descriptions have been identified through analysis of provider labels.  The,,,,,,,,
,,meanings of these additional descriptions were sufficiently different when compared to the Standard,,,,,,,,
,,labels to warrant their use.   These additional descriptions are hereafter referred to as the NONSTANDARD,,,,,,,,
,,"labels.  Included with the nonstandard descriptions are ""Other . . ."" designations to provide for situations",,,,,,,,
,,"where no match in meaning can be found.  Refer to Worksheet A, lines 25, 39,  and 53.  Both the standard",,,,,,,,
,,and nonstandard cost center descriptions along with their cost center codes are shown on Table 5.,,,,,,,,
,,"The ""USE"" column on that table indicates the number of times that a given code can be used on one",,,,,,,,
,,cost report.  You are required to compare your added label to the descriptions shown on the standard,,,,,,,,
,,and nonstandard table for purposes of selecting a code.  Most CMS approved software provides an,,,,,,,,
,,automated process to present you with the allowable choices for the line/column being coded and ,,,,,,,,
,,automatically associate the code for the selected matching description with your label.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,        Additional Guidelines,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,Categories,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,You must make your selection from the proper category such as general service description for general,,,,,,,,
,,"service lines, ancillary descriptions for ancillary cost center lines, etc.",,,,,,,,

,,Use of Cost Center Coding Description More Than Once,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,Often a description from the standard or nonstandard tables applies to more than one of the labels,,,,,,,,
,,"being added by the preparer.  In the past, it was necessary to determine which code was to be used and",,,,,,,,
,,then increment the code number upwards by one for each subsequent use.  This was done to provide a,,,,,,,,
,,"unique code for each cost center label.  Now, most approved software associate the proper code, including",,,,,,,,
,,"increments as required, once a matching description is selected.  Remember to use your label.  You are",,,,,,,,
,,matching to CMS's description only for coding purposes.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,Cost Center Coding and Line Restrictions,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,Cost center codes may only be used in designated lines in accordance with the classification of the cost,,,,,,,,
,,"center(s), i.e., lines 1 through 6 may only contain cost center codes within the general service cost center",,,,,,,,
,,"category of both standard and nonstandard coding.  For example, in the general service cost center",,,,,,,,
,,"category for Operation of Plant cost, line 3 and subscripts thereof should only contain cost center codes",,,,,,,,
,,of 0300-0349 and nonstandard cost center codes.  This logic must hold true for all other cost center,,,,,,,,
,,"categories, i.e., inpatient care services, visiting services, and hospice nonreimbursable services cost centers.",,,,,,,,
