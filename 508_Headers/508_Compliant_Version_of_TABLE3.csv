,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,INTRODUCTION,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,This table identifies those data elements necessary to calculate a hospice cost report.  It also identifies ,,,,,,,
,,"some figures from a completed cost report.  These calculated fields (e.g., Worksheet B, column 7) are ",,,,,,,
,,needed to verify the mathematical accuracy of the raw data elements and to isolate differences between ,,,,,,,
,,the file submitted by the hospital complex and the report produced by the fiscal intermediary.  Where an,,,,,,,
,,"adjustment is made, that record must be present in the electronic data file.  For explanations of the",,,,,,,
,,"adjustment required, refer to the cost report instructions.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,"Table 3 ""Usage"" column is used to specify the format of each data item as follows:",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,9,"  Numeric, greater than or equal to zero.",,,,
,,,,-9,"  Numeric, may be either greater than or less than zero.",,,,
,,,,9(x).9(y),"  Numeric, greater than zero, with x or fewer significant",,,,
,,,,,"    digits to the left of the decimal point, a decimal point,",,,,
,,,,,    and exactly y digits to the right of the decimal point.,,,,
,,,,X,  Character.,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,Consistency in line numbering (and column numbering for general service cost centers) for each cost ,,,,,,,
,,center is essential.  The sequence of some cost centers does change among worksheets. ,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,"Table 3 refers to the data elements needed from a standard cost report.  When a standard line is subscripted,",,,,,,,
,,"the subscripted lines must be numbered sequentially with the first subline number displayed as ""01"" or ""1""",,,,,,,
,,"in field locations 14-15.  It is unacceptable to format in series of 10, 20,  or skip subline numbers (i.e., 01, ",,,,,,,
,,"03, except for skipping subline numbers for prior year cost center(s) deleted in the current period or initially",,,,,,,
,,created cost center(s) no longer in existence after cost finding).  Exceptions are specified in this manual.,,,,,,,
,,"For ""Other (specify)"" lines, i.e. any other non cost center lines, all subscripted lines should be in",,,,,,,
,,"sequence and consecutively numbered beginning with subscripted subline ""01"".  Automated systems",,,,,,,
,,should reorder these numbers where the provider skips or deletes a line number in the series.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,Drop all records with zero values from the file.  Any record absent from a file is treated as if it were zero.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,All numeric values are presumed positive.  Leading minus signs may only appear in data with values,,,,,,,
,,"less than zero which are specified in Table 3 with a usage of ""-9"". ",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,Italic script within this table denotes adjustments which are not displayed in the print image or hard copy,,,,,,,
,,"of the cost report, but are contained in the ECR file.",,,,,,,
